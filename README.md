# Swift-Route-Finder
The Swift Route Finder is a C++ program that uses a graph to represent various locations within a specific area. This program is user defined, users will be able to find the shortest path between two locations within the city. This is done through the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. It efficiently calculates the path while providing the sequence of steps the user would take to reach their destination. In case of an emergency, the program identifies and displays the nearest hospital. This feature is considered important during any urgent medical assistance. It utilizes classes for vertices, edges, and the graph itself, as well as the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding. The code has classes encapsulating the above-mentioned functionalities. These include the graph class, which manages the overall structure, and the solution class, which is responsible for implementing the Dijkstra algorithm.
